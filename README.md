# Channel-Based Concurrency in C

This project implements a concurrency model in C using channels, inspired by the concurrency primitives found in languages like Go. Channels in this context are used for communication between threads, enabling synchronized data exchange and coordination. The implementation supports both buffered and unbuffered channels, blocking and non-blocking sends and receives, and channel selection for multiplexing operations.
